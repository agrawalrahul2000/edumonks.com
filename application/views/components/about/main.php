				<h5>The Edumonks Story</h5>
			</div>
			<p>
				<b>THE PROBLEM&nbsp;</b><i>we are trying to solve</i><b></b>
			</p>
			<p>With the steady rise of college tuition costs in recent years,
				prospective &amp; current students and their parents are being
				forced to take personal or student loans, many a times amounting to
				lakhs of rupees. &nbsp;We believe scholarships can play a
				significant role in reducing if not eliminating such loans.
				Scholarships can play a significant role in shaping a student&#039;s
				path. Scholarships are awarded for a variety of reasons, including
				academic achievement, demonstrated leadership, community service,
				overcoming adversity, sports and a whole range of other
				characteristics.</p>
			<p>Most of the information about scholarships are scattered across
				various websites, in various newspaper advertisements or even buried
				in some file in a corner of a room. Although there are some websites
				that cater to scholarships for Indian students, we found them below
				even the minimum quality expectation of a student. They are just a
				list of some of the scholarships arranged randomly and even that is
				riddled with outdated and inaccurate information. The facility of
				search in unheard of or if present is in very primitive state.</p>
			<p>
				<b>THE SOLUTION&nbsp;</b><i>which hopefully will make things easier</i><b></b>
			</p>
			<p>And so, having understood how difficult it is for parents and
				students to find genuine leads for scholarship possibilities, we
				created Edumonks.com to solve their problems. &nbsp;Edumonks.com is
				the most comprehensive database for scholarships targeting Indian
				Students.&nbsp; It is fast, easy and&nbsp;free&nbsp;way to find
				scholarships on the Internet.&nbsp; It delivers accurate and timely
				search results that have been filtered and customized to match
				unique user profiles. With roughly xx thousand scholarships worth
				more than yy million, there are scholarships for
				every&nbsp;student&#039;s educational goals, activities and interests.</p>
			<p>We have built edumonks.com using the right technology and search
				processes and the right system for research and data entry. However
				we are still in the first phase of our development and we will
				continue to strive to improve our site more and more.</p>
			<p>
				<b>THE MOTIVATION</b>&nbsp;<i>that keeps us going</i>
			</p>
			<p>We are committed to empower students&#039; lives through information
				and innovation, creating an environment in which the scholarship and
				financial aid industry is better defined and more attainable. We
				strive to remain as student-centered as possible.</p>

				better education. Our motto is &quot;Enabling Education&quot; and this
				scholarship portal is the first little step in that direction. We
